## About The Project
<img src="./src/components/images/aboutProject.png">

### As my secound interview i had to build a quote generator useing either local storage /session storage or a database then be able to add a users own quote to it.   
### I decided to go with both database storage and local storage.
### one used for saving users data and the other for using an api since i did not want to save api data to my storage i decided to make two pages of content for them

These were my Low/Mid fedelity Wireframes.  
Since i had a time limit i  did not want to get hooked into doing wireframes for many days, so i spent most of the time building the site since things change while building.

## Trouble Shooting  
There was alot of Problems when it came to the database i thought it would be a  great idea to use pre written code i had used with firebase to just get the data back and to send it but . . .  
Firebase has recently upgraded their code to use a new layout so i had to google search and trial and test untill i could get it working.

I really enjoyed working on this project.
Next time im going to try mongoDb Atlas since i have been learning that and it seem very simple like firebase they now use cloud storage with async data
